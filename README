Rift Dev Tracker to Twitter Bot
See LICENSE for license details.

See live version @ https://twitter.com/RiftDevTracker

Perl is required.  The following Perl modules are also required.  Install them
via CPAN or your distribution's package manager if available:

* Net::Twitter
* XML::RSS::Parser
* LWP::UserAgent
* Unicode::Normalize
* XML::LibXML
* Date::Parse
* WWW::Shorten
* Proc::Daemon
* IO::Handle
* Config::Simple
* Cwd

A Twitter development application is required for posting to Twitter. Register
and set up a Twitter account and also create an application at
https://dev.twitter.com/apps . You will need to enter your consumer key,
consumer secret, access token, and access token secret into the config file
(rdt.conf in the same directory as rdt.pl).

Once the Twitter dev app is set up, the perl modules are installed, and the
config file is filled in, simply cd in and run "perl rdt.pl".

The bot will wait 15 minutes and then check for new posts at the RSS URL set in
the config file.  It will post any new titles to Twitter, then wait about 15
minutes and repeat. 

Note that at least for Rift, there is a delay before dev posts get on to the dev
tracker of at least 10 minutes, and there also is a TTL of 60 minutes on the RSS
feed.  Combined with the bot's built-in rate limiting, you must expect some time
to pass before dev tracker posts are tweeted.

A log file is created at ./rdt.log. Verbosity can be increased in the config 
file by setting DEBUG to "1" for activity logging or "2" for that and verbose 
post title logging as well.

Some considerations have been made for extending this code to other RSS feeds,
but they have not been tested.
